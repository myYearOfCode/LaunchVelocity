# Launch Velocity
[![Codeship Status for myYearOfCode/LaunchVelocity](https://app.codeship.com/projects/6a5d6320-62d6-0137-3ff6-3a865b8a8fbe/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/344480)

Launch Velocity is a dashboard to view github commits for each member of Launch Academy's 24th cohort. It allows you to sort by a variety of criteria and click through to check out a person's github profile. It can be seen [here on heroku](https://launch-velocity.herokuapp.com/)

It is hyper-specific in it's current state, but it could easily be forked to cover a different group of developers.
